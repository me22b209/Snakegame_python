# Snakegame_python
A classic Snake game built with Python and Pygame, featuring both manual player control and an AI-controlled mode that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for pathfinding. The AI mode automatically guides the snake toward the food while avoiding collisions.
# Snake Game(Python + Pygame)

This is a classic Snake Game built using Python and the Pygame library. The goal of the game is to control the snake, collect food, and avoid hitting the boundaries or the snakeâ€™s own body. The snake grows longer each time it eats the food, increasing the difficulty of the game.

## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to control the direction of the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Eat the red food squares to gain points.
- If the snake touches the wall or itself, the game is over.
- Try to make the highest score!

## Features

- Smooth snake movement
- Scoring system
- Game over detection
- Restart option (optional if coded)
- Simple and beginner-friendly code structure

---
## How to run the game

In your terminal or command prompt, run:
```bash
python snakegame.py
```

## About This Project

This Snake Game is a simple arcade-style game where the player controls a snake moving around the screen to eat food. Every time the snake eats the food, it grows longer and the player's score increases. The main challenge is to avoid crashing into the walls or into the snake's own body.

The purpose of this project was not just to recreate a classic game, but also to understand how real-time games work using Python. It gave me hands-on experience with concepts like:

- Game loops and frame rendering
- Handling keyboard events
- Collision detection
- Modular and clean code structure
- Working with external libraries (Pygame)

Building this game helped improve my coding skills and taught me how to create a complete project and publish it on GitHub. It is a great beginner-level project for anyone wanting to learn Python through practical application.
